### BACKGROUND
The Vega shrink-wrapper from OCME is deployed in large production lines in the food and beverage industry. 
The machine groups loose bottles or cans into set package sizes, wraps them in plastic film and then heat-shrinks the plastic 
film to combine them into a package. The plastic film is fed into the machine from large spools and is then cut to the length 
needed to wrap the film around a pack of goods. The cutting assembly is an important component of the machine to meet the high 
availability target. Therefore, the blade needs to be set-up and maintained properly. Furthermore, the blade can not be inspected 
visually during operation due to the blade being enclosed in a metal housing and its fast rotation speed. Monitoring the cutting 
blades degradation will increase the machines reliability and reduce unexpected downtime caused by failed cuts.

### ABOUT REPOSITORY
This repository contains the complete project showcasing the degradation of a cutting blade in a food and beverage industry. 
It predicts at what time the blade shows anomalous behavior and also plots the different sensor data values in real time.

• This repository consists of files required to deploy this ___Machine Learning Project__ as a __Web App created 
with Flask___ on ___Heroku___ platform.
